Documentation this example is base on:

- https://adamtheautomator.com/postgres-to-kubernetes/#Deploying_PostgreSQL_to_Kubernetes_Manually
    - ^^^ this is sort of bad. It spawns a deployment with 3 replicas. Which is not HA.
    - Either we have 3 instances messing on the same /mnt/data dir
    - or it's unclear what pod on what node has what datadir
    - or it is unclear how to access which postgres instance if this is ment as standalone instance
